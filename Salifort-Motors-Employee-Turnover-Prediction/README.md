# Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on analyzing employee data collected by the **HR department** at **Salifort Motors** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and implement strategies to improve satisfaction and retention. By leveraging **Python** and machine learning techniques, this project provides actionable insights to reduce turnover rates, save costs, and enhance organizational performance.

## Project Goals

1. **Predict Employee Turnover**: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.  
2. **Identify Key Factors**: Analyze factors contributing to turnover, such as job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, and career growth opportunities.  
3. **Improve Retention**: Use insights from the model to implement targeted retention strategies.  
4. **Cost Savings**: Reduce recruitment, hiring, and training costs by retaining existing talent.

## Key Features and Techniques

### **Turnover Prediction Models**
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model to predict the probability of an employee leaving based on job satisfaction, salary, and tenure.  
- **Decision Tree**: An interpretable model to classify employees as likely to stay or leave, highlighting key decision factors.  
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees and reducing overfitting.  
- **XGBoost**: A gradient-boosting algorithm for high-accuracy turnover prediction.  

### **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted and engineered features such as:  
  - Job satisfaction levels  
  - Salary and benefits  
  - Work-life balance metrics  
  - Tenure and promotion history  
  - Department and role-specific factors  
- Handled missing data, outliers, and categorical variables for model readiness.  

### **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC**.  
- Used **cross-validation** to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting.  
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key drivers of turnover.  

### **Data Visualization**
- Created visualizations to explore trends, such as:  
  - Turnover rates by department, role, or tenure  
  - Correlation between job satisfaction and turnover  
  - Impact of salary and benefits on retention
