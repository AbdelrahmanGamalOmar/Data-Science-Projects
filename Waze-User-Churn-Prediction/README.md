# Waze User Churn Prediction and Taxi Fare Optimization - Machine Learning Project

This project This project is part of my learning journey with the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate program. focuses on developing a **machine learning model** to predict user churn for **Waze**, a popular navigation app. The goal is to identify users who are likely to uninstall the app or stop using it, enabling Waze to take proactive measures to improve user retention and grow its business. Additionally, the project includes a **multiple regression model** to predict taxi fares, which can be used to optimize revenue for the **New York Taxi and Limousine Commission** and its drivers.

## Project Goals

1. **Predict User Churn**: Develop a model to predict monthly user churn, helping Waze identify at-risk users and implement retention strategies.
2. **Improve User Retention**: Use insights from the model to reduce churn rates and increase user engagement.
3. **Optimize Revenue**: Build a multiple regression model to predict taxi fares, contributing to a suite of tools for revenue optimization.

## Key Features and Techniques

### **Churn Prediction Models**
- **Decision Tree**: A simple yet interpretable model to classify users as churned or retained based on features such as app usage, session duration, and user demographics.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees and reducing overfitting.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient-boosting algorithm that provides high accuracy and performance for churn prediction.

### **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted and engineered relevant features from user data, such as:
  - Frequency of app usage
  - Session duration
  - User demographics (age, location, etc.)
  - Historical churn patterns
- Handled missing data, outliers, and categorical variables to ensure high-quality input for the models.

### **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to ensure robust performance.
- Used **cross-validation** to assess model generalizability and avoid overfitting.
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key drivers of churn.

### **Taxi Fare Prediction (Multiple Regression)**
- Built a regression model to predict taxi fares based on features such as trip distance, time of day, and location.
- This model is part of a larger suite of tools aimed at optimizing revenue for taxi drivers and the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission.
